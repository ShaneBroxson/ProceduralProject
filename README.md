# ProceduralProject
Project created by Shane Broxson. Made in the summer of 2019. At beginning had no prior experience with C++ or C. Created for project assignment in summer course COP2001 (Programming Metholodogy). Worked on in class and out of class for about ~15-20 hours a week until firm grasp was held on what was being done with the language. At first was unsure about how the language worked but now would be able to branch into different utilites of C++ with ease. Working in some depth quickly in this language allowed for the opportunity of learning how to learn other languages without struggle.
## Demonstration
Add an animated gif of your program running. You can use ShareX, GIPHY Capture or another tool. https://blog.github.com/2018-06-29-GIF-that-keeps-on-GIFing/ Note for school project: This is a great way for friends and family to easily see your project in action. The markdown is ![ProjectGIF](docs/ProceduralProject.gif)
## Documentation
Create a docs folder in your project. If using Java, generate JavaDoc in your IDE. If using C++, use Doxygen. Change repository settings (using Settings at top of page) to use GitHub Pages with your docs folder. Add a link to the javadoc/doxygen index.html file with this markdown: [Text to appear](URL) 
The URL will be YourGitHubUserName.github.io/YourRepositoryName/foldername/filename
Do not include the docs folder name in your URL. 
Sample: [JavaDoc](https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html) 
## Diagrams
## Getting Started
Instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on someone's local machine for development and testing purposes. 
Note for real project: You want to be able to share your project and enable collaboration. 
Note for school project: You want a potential client or hirer to be able to run your program.

## History
Started with all vectors being passed in seperatly to deal and save all data being worked on. 
Added files to save data on.
Added code to populate vectors with existing data when program starts.
Changed vectors to be added to struct at beginning of file and associated function calls.
