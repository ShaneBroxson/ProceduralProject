# ProceduralProject
One paragraph of project description goes here.
Briefly address the 5 W's. 
What is the project?
Who made it? Did you make it independently or with a team?
When did you make it? At what level of experience and proficiency were / are you?
Why did you make it? For fun? For an assignment? How does it relect you as a person?
Where did you make it? What school / class?
Note for school project: this may be the only thing someone visiting your page reads. 
Try to make a great impresison. Make someone want to hire you. 
This section will also be useful to you in the future to remind you about the project.
## Demonstration
Add an animated gif of your program running. You can use ShareX, GIPHY Capture or another tool. https://blog.github.com/2018-06-29-GIF-that-keeps-on-GIFing/ Note for school project: This is a great way for friends and family to easily see your project in action. The markdown is ![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.png) 
## Documentation
Create a docs folder in your project. If using Java, generate JavaDoc in your IDE. If using C++, use Doxygen. Change repository settings (using Settings at top of page) to use GitHub Pages with your docs folder. Add a link to the javadoc/doxygen index.html file with this markdown: [Text to appear](URL) 
The URL will be YourGitHubUserName.github.io/YourRepositoryName/foldername/filename
Do not include the docs folder name in your URL. 
Sample: [JavaDoc](https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html) 
## Diagrams
## Getting Started
Instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on someone's local machine for development and testing purposes. 
Note for real project: You want to be able to share your project and enable collaboration. 
Note for school project: You want a potential client or hirer to be able to run your program.
